Man, just walked out of Revelations, and, like, I'm buzzing but also kinda want my two hours back? I can't decide if I'm thrilled or utterly confused. Agh! The opening scene was like, BAM, throws you right into the deep end, but then it just... swirls around like water in a clogged drain. Visually stunning, sure, but come on. The plot felt like spaghetti thrown against a wall — none of the noodles stuck.

That lead actor, though... what was his name? Jim? John? Whatever. He seriously looked like he walked straight off a 90’s boy band tour bus. All smolder and no substance. There was this moment where he looked out into the sea — why are they always looking into the damn sea? — and I swear the sound of the waves sounded just like my dishwasher running. At one point, he’s clutching this ragged piece of fabric, like it’s supposed to mean something deep, but it just reminded me of my old high school gym towel. Just lying there. Taking up space.

> And don't get me started on that soundtrack. It was like someone took jazz, orchestral, and dubstep, shook it up in a cocktail shaker, and poured it over the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 like a questionable sauce. By the end, I just wanted to shout, We get it! Be dramatic! To add some irony, I think I'll actually 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and have it play as background noise for my cat. She'll probably appreciate the chaos.

Characters popped up like those annoying notifications you get when the Wi-Fi cuts out. They were there, then gone. The guy with the hat — was he a secret agent? A ghost? An embodiment of my subconscious guilt for leaving my laundry wet too long? Guess we'll never truly know. And the scriptwriter was clearly a fan of those deep, thought-provoking one-liners. Much like fortune cookies, but without the benefit of a sweet treat at the end.

For some reason, near the half-point, I start noting down imaginary C++ code snippets as if trying to unscramble the mess: 
```cpp
int revelation = 0;
while(revelation < 100){
    revelation++;
    break;
}
```
I don't even know what I'm doing at this point.

Ultimately, who am I kidding? I’ll probably 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 Revelations again, if only to try and unravel that mess of a plot. Or make fun of it with friends. Or maybe just as a reminder that life, like  s, doesn't always make sense—and that sometimes it’s kinda beautiful and exhausting all at the same time. Or maybe it's just a lesson in never trusting  s with mind-bending titles. Ugh, I need a nap.
